1- Trap Door functions are those functions which are easy to computer in one side but extrmely difficult to reverse it.

   One perfect example of this is the modulus function

   m mod p = e

   m = 3^29
   p = 17
   e = 17


   but if we have e = 17, p = 17 then it is extremely difficult to find the exponent value which will be 29

   This is why it is called trap door function
